## ‚öôÔ∏è Description

Simple & lightweight react-native package to help you make your mobile app look terrific on every screen size. You may use the following functions to make your app more responsive.

| Function Name                         | Input                                                                         | Output                                                          | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MOST POPULAR:** `responsive.size()` | number of pixels                                                              | number of pixels proportional to screen's height/width          | If you use `responsive.size(10)` then you will receive 10 pixels on iPhone 14 Pro, but slightly different number of pixels for other screen sizes, such as 8 pixels on a smaller iPhone SE or 12 pixels on a larger iPhone 12 Max |
| `responsive.width()`                  | number from 0-100, which corresponds to the percentage of the screen's width  | number of pixels equal to the percentage of the screen's width  | If you use `responsive.width(50)` then you will receive a number of pixels equal to 50% of the screen's width                                                                                                                     |
| `responsive.height()`                 | number from 0-100, which corresponds to the percentage of the screen's height | number of pixels equal to the percentage of the screen's height | If you use `responsive.height(50)` then you will receive a number of pixels equal to 50% of the screen's height                                                                                                                   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Before & After Video Demonstration

- Video can be found below, but if you cannot see it, then please [follow this link](https://github.com/react-native-responsive-sizes/react-native-responsive-sizes).
- In the video below, you can see how the app looks before and after using `react-native-responsive-sizes`
- In the BEFORE code, you can see that the styles use constant values, such as: height of 600, marginTop of 10, marginHorizontal of 10, etc.
- But in the AFTER code, you can see some very simple changes were made: responsive.size(600), responsive.size(10), responsive.size(10), etc.
- With those changes, the app looks much proportional on screens of different aspect ratios.
